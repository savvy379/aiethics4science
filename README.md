# AI Ethics for Scientists
A collection of AI Ethics education material developed specifically for scientists (typically taught to PhD students in scientific disciplines, but appropriate for general scientific audiences). This material has been used to provide AI Ethics instruction in a variety of contexts including the [SLAC Summer Institute](https://indico.slac.stanford.edu/event/7540/), [The Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing](https://extremecomputingtraining.anl.gov/agenda-2023/#Track-8), [The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Corporation Data Science Fellowship Program](https://github.com/LSSTC-DSFP/LSSTC-DSFP-Sessions/tree/main/Sessions/Session17) and the [SMART-HEP Network](https://www.smarthep.org/). The repository is divided into three sections. 

## AI Ethics and Responsible Data Science for Scientists Course
This is 6-hour mini-course on AI Ethics and Responsible Data Science and includes 3 lectures and 2 guided, hands-on coding examples. 
* **Lecture 1: Overview**
  * a taxonomy of AI Ethics considerations (data collection and storage, task design and learning incentives, model bias and fairness, model robustness, system deployment and outcomes, and downstrem/diffuse impacs) including real world examples of each consideration.
  *  Why scientists should be engaging with AI Ethics
  *  Scientific frameworks for evaluating ML/AI models
  *  Discussion activities to practice evaluating real systems
*  **Hands-on 1:** Exploring sources of unfairness and mistakes in ML models: a case study on COMPAS
*  **Lecture 2: Explainable AI**
   * Local explanation methods
   * Global explanation methods
   * Real examples applying examplainability methods to physics models
   * Limitations of AI explainability/interpretability
   * Transparency, documentation, and model auditing
* **Hands-on 2:** Implementing explainability methods SHAP and LIME
* **Lecture 3: Other Topics in AI Ethics**
  * Model monitoring
  * Quantitative fairness
  * Privacy
  * Regulation
  * Participatory design
